Interviewer: Thank you for meeting with us today. As an architect designing a new hospital, we want to ensure that we understand your fireproofing needs. So, let's start with the questions.

What specific fireproofing services are you looking for in the hospital design?
Architect: Thank you for asking. We are looking for fireproofing services to protect the hospital and its occupants from fire hazards.

What are the most critical areas of the hospital that require fireproofing?
Architect: We need fireproofing in all areas of the hospital, but the most critical areas are the emergency rooms, operating rooms, and the electrical rooms.

What are your budget constraints for fireproofing?
Architect: We have a budget of $500,000 for the fireproofing work.

Have you had any fire-related incidents in the past? If yes, can you elaborate on them?
Architect: Fortunately, we have not had any fire-related incidents in the past, but we want to ensure that the hospital is fireproofed correctly.

What are the safety requirements and regulations that hospitals need to comply with?
Architect: Hospitals need to comply with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) regulations, the local building codes, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) regulations.

How much downtime can you tolerate during the fireproofing process?
Architect: We would prefer the fireproofing work to be completed as quickly as possible, but we understand that it may take some time to do it right.

What is your expected timeline for the fireproofing project?
Architect: We would like the fireproofing work to be completed within 6 months.

What type of building materials are you using in the hospital construction?
Architect: We are using a mixture of steel, concrete, and other fire-resistant materials in the hospital construction.

Do you have any specific fireproofing standards that you want the fireproofing business to meet?
Architect: We want the fireproofing to meet the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code and the UL 1709 standard for fireproofing.

Are you looking for a long-term partnership with the fireproofing business or a one-time service?
Architect: We are looking for a one-time service for the fireproofing work. However, if we are satisfied with the work, we would consider a long-term partnership for future projects.
